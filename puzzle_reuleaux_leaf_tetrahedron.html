		<h1>Reuleaux Leaf Tetrahedron</h1>
		<center><img src="images/leaf_tetrahedron.jpg"></center>
		<p>
		At first glance, this puzzle doesn't look like it's going to be very interesting at all,
		but I was pleasantly surprised!  It's quite cleaver and has some interesting cases.
		According to a website, it was invented by Yukang Wu, whoever that guy is.
		</p>
		<p>
		With one side of the tetrahedron on a table and one side facing you, two sides face away
		from you.  The left edge we'll denote with <code>L</code>, the right, <code>R</code>, and
		the edge behind, <code>B</code>.  We will have no need to refer to the remaining 3 edges
		resting on the table.  Of course, after re-orienting the puzzle, the edges <code>L</code>,
		<code>R</code> and <code>B</code> reassign.  Every edge can turn 90 degrees, and the puzzle
		does not bandage.  Though it's not immediately obvious, you can convince yourself that
		the puzzle has a 3x3x3 core.
		</p>
		<p>
		There are some fun parts to this puzzle.  You have the tiny face triangles which are dualed,
		if you will, by an internal kind of spikey "face" piece that hides behind the leaf peices.  And then
		there are, of course, the edge peices.  The internal "faces" or spikes are hidden when the
		puzzle is in the solved state, and the tiny triangle face pieces can become hidden too.
		The whole puzzle shape-shifts in really cool ways.
		</p>
		<p>
		We will use <code>|U|</code> to denote a rotation of 120 degrees of the puzzle about
		an axis that sticks up from the table and orthogonal to its surface.  Looking down at
		the table from above, this is a clock-wise rotation.  Of course, <code>|U'|</code> would
		denote a counter-clock-wise rotation of the puzzle.  Once the puzzle is rotated, the meaning
		of <code>L</code>, <code>R</code> and <code>B</code> changes due to the new orientation.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 1</h3>
		<p>
		Get the puzzle back into tetrahedral shape.
		</p>
		<h4>Step 1.A</h4>
		<p>
		Start rotating just the edge pieces so that they, regardless everything else, form the
		edges of a tetrahedron.  Interestingly, if you don't pay attention to color at this step,
		you can get the whole puzzle back into tetrahedral shape, but once you do, you won't be
		able to finish the solve.  So make sure the edges are oriented properly with respect to
		one another, with regard to both shape and color.
		</p>
		<h4>Step 1.B</h4>
		<p>
		Use <code>X=R',L,R,L'</code> to swap the pair of faces pieces, one right in front of you,
		the other inside the top vertex.  Either face piece could be a tiny triangle or an internal
		spikey "face" piece.  You want to involve both kinds in the swap, because your goal is to move
		all the kinds of face pieces around so that they're in their proper places relative to the
		edges.  The internal spikey "face" pieces should be at the vertices of the tetrahedron, while
		the tiny triangle face pieces should be in the center of the faces of the tetrahedron.
		</p>
		<p>
		A tricky case can happen where a said swap solves one pair, but then unsolves another.  You may
		have to move some stuff out of the way, do the swap, and then restore.
		</p>
		<p>
		Note that an interesting case occurs near the end of the solve that is due to an ambiguity
		in this step, which is simply that it is not clear which internal spikey "faces" should be at
		which vertices.  Swapping pairs of such "faces" creates or destroys a parity error at the
		last step of the solve.  (This is the classic "it can't be solved by tri-cycles" problem, because
		a swap is needed.)  Anyhow, just be aware of that.  There's no obvious way I know of as for
		how to account for it at this step.  If you encounter the parity error near the end of the solve,
		then, interestingly, a backtrack won't be needed, as is often the case with other puzzles.
		</p>
		<h4>Step 1.C</h4>
		<p>
		Once all faces are positioned, use <code>2X</code> to flatten the pedals.
		This move will flatten a pedal in the front face at top/center, and a pedal in
		the back/left face at top/center as well.  Don't worry about preserving the edge
		orientations at this stage, provided you move them in multiples of 180 degrees, not 90.
		You can also use <code>2X'</code> to flatten similarly with pedals in the front and back/right
		faces.  Your choice of 180 degree turns of all the edges prepare you for applications of
		<code>2X</code> or <code>2X'</code> to get all the pedals flattened.
		</p>
		<p>
		Once this step is complete, the puzzle is back in tetrahedral shape.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 2</h3>
		<p>
		Get all faces of the tetrahedron to be one color.
		</p>
		<h4>Step 2.A</h4>
		<p>
		Restore the proper edge orientations, respecting colors of the edges.
		In other words, just resolve the edges.  Super quick and easy.
		</p>
		<h4>Step 2.B</h4>
		<p>
		Move the pedals into position, using setups as needed.  I use two sequences for this.
		</p>
		<p>
		The first is <code>2X,|U'|,2X</code>, which rotates the 3 pedals covering
		the internal spikey "face" for the top vertex of the tetrehadon (as it rests on a table.)
		The pedals rotate clock-wise when viewing the vertex from above.  Of course, this is
		a tri-cycle.
		</p>
		<p>
		The second is the trivial tri-cycle <code>2[L,R]</code>.  It's easy to see exactly
		which 3 pidals this tri-cycles/rotates.
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, it's also good to know how to peform these tri-cycles in the opposite
		directions, and of course, it's just the inverses <code>2X',|U|,2X'</code> and
		<code>2[R,L]</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
		You'll find that you may need to use one of these as a setup move for the other.
		Some setups need to be a bit more elaborate to get all the pudals solved.
		</p>
		<h4>Step 2.C</h4>
		<p>
		Lastly, solve the tiny triangle face pieces.  A tri-cycle for them is
		<code>2[L,R],B,(2[L,R])',B'</code>.  Memorizing the inverse is helpful too.
		</p>
		<p>
		As was said earlier, you can run into a problem here where the puzzle doesn't solve,
		because the remaining unsolved faces are a pair, which, of course, can't be tri-cycled
		into position.  This is the afformentioned pairty error.  To solve it, just use
		<code>3X</code> three times to swap a pair of internal spikey "faces".  Now you can
		tri-cycle the remaining unsolved tiny triangle faces using tri-cycles.
		</p>
		<p>
		Even better, I just found <code>B,3[R,'L,R',L],B'</code> which solves the parity out-right.
