		<h1>Mixup cube</h1>
		<p>
		I really like this puzzle, although the one I bought didn't turn very well and eventually broke.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 1</h3>
		<p>
		    Get it back into cube shape, but do it without disturbing the current parity of the middle slices.  That is, a single
            45-degree rotation of a middle slice is fine, but it must be undone.  In other words, such rotations are fine as setup moves.
		</p>
        <p>
            For example, do a single 45-degree rotation of a middle slice as a setup, then tri-cycle edge locations to get center and edge
            pieces in their proper locations, even if not in their proper orientations, then undo the setup.
        </p>
        <p>
            To orient edges in edge locations when they're off by 90-degrees (as apposed to 180-degrees, which is only possible on a 3x3),
            I use <code>(1/2)Zi,Xi,F,X,(1/2)Z</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that, collectively, there will be a proper orientation of the center pieces, but this won't be clear until the puzzle
            is nearly solved.
        </p>
		<h3>Step 2</h3>
		<p>
            Once back in cube shape, get the centers in proper position relative to one another, then try solving as a 3x3.
            If doing layer-solve, the last layer will tell you what kind of parity problem(s), if any, you have.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if a single edge is flipped (which can't happen on a 3x3), then simply do a setup move that allows you to
            flip that edge with a center put in an edge location (since edges are flipped in pairs on a 3x3.)
        </p>
        <p>
            If everything is solved, except two corners need to swap, then you need to do a 45-degree rotation of any middle slice,
            then begin again at step 1 above.
        </p>
