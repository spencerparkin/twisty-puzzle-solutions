		<h1>Multi Skewb</h1>
		<p>
		This puzzle was invented by a guy named Greg who, apparently, invents all sorts of twisty puzzles.  It is a harder varient of the master skewb, and contains that puzzles as a factor group.  The set of all sequences that preserves the inner core part of the puzzle forms a normal sub-group.  Mod-ing out by this sub-group gives us the master skewb.
		</p>
		<p>
		For this puzzle, I'm going to let <code>W=ULF</code>, <code>X=URF</code>, <code>Y=URB</code> and <code>Z=ULB</code>.
		The associated middle layers will be denoted by <code>W'</code>, <code>X'</code>, <code>Y'</code> and <code>Z'</code>, respectively.  The corresponding corner twists in the bottom layer will be denoted by <code>w</code>, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>, respectively.  (E.g., <code>y=DRB</code>.)  The meaning of, say, <code>y'</code> should now be clear.  Note that <code>y'=Wi'</code>.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 1</h3>
		<p>
		Solve the inner edges (as apposed to the inner corners) relative to the center dots.  Just keep twisting and it practically solves itself.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 2</h3>
		<p>
		Align the center window peices with the center dots.  Use <code>W,Y,Wi,Yi</code> to preserve step 1.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 3</h3>
		<p>
		Solve the corner positions.  Use <code>Q=3[W,Y,Wi,Yi]</code> with setups to do a pair of corner swaps, one in the top layer and one in the bottom.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 4</h3>
		<p>
		Orient the corners.  Use <code>X,Q,Xi,Q</code> to twist a pair of corners in the top layer.  Note that <code>Qi=Q</code>.
		Note the obviouse variant <code>Xi,Q,X,Q</code> for twisting in the opposite direction.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 5</h3>
		<p>
		Solve the bars.  Use <code>S,y,Si,yi</code> where <code>S=3[W'i,Y,W',Yi]</code> with setups to tri-cycle bars.  A useful varient is <code>T,wi,Ti,w</code> where <code>T=3[Y',Wi,Y'i,W]</code>.  This is the most tedious part of the solve, only because the sequence here is a bit long.  The setups aren't too hard.  In some cases, doing 2 tri-cycles instead of a long, complicated setup is easier.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 6</h3>
		<p>
		All that remains now is to position the outer edge peices which are inseparably connected to the inner corners.  A pure try-cicle sequence is given by <code>2[U,Yi,Ui,Y,|2Y|]</code> with <code>U=W'i,Y',W',Yi'</code>.
