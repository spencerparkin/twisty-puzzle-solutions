		<h1>5x3x3 Cube</h1>
		<h3>Step 1</h3>
		<p>
		I start by just doing a layer solve with either the white, yellow, green or blue
		face as the first layer.  Ignore the two 1x3x3 layers that pad a 3x3x3 as you
		restore both shape and color.  The next step addresses the finaly layer of
		the well-known layer method.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 2</h3>
		<p>
		The final layer becomes interesting only because the corners don't necessarly
		solve, though the edges do.  To remedy this case, you must realize that there
		is ambiguity in two of the four edges in the final layer.  Two of those edges
		can be positioned on either side of the cube.  The edges mentioned here are those
		that connect with the 1x3x3 extraneous layers.  What you simply need to do is
		swap their positions, and then the corners will tri-cycle into place.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 3</h3>
		<p>
		With the inner 3x3x3 solved, you now need ony solve the two 1x3x3 layers.
		I solve edges, then corners in one layer, then the same in the other.
		</p>
		<p>
		Adapted for this puzzle, a useful and well-known sequence for edge perumtation
		is <code>A,B,Ai,Bi</code> where <code>A=2R,U,2Ri,Ui</code> and <code>B=2Li,Ui,2L,U</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Tri-cycling corners in the last layer may require a setup of <code>2F</code> if you
		are using some varient of <code>2[U,2R,Ui,2R]</code>.
