		<h1>Curvy Copter 3</h1>
		<h3>Step 1</h3>
		<p>
		Complete all steps in the solution for the <a href="puzzle_curvy_copter.html">curvy copter</a>.
		It is easy to see which faces of the curvy copter 3 correspond to those of the original curvy copter.
		All that will remain to be solved are the little peddal peices and the center peices.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 2</h3>
		<p>
		Solve the center peices using <code>2[RU,LU]</code> and its obvious varients.  This just tri-cycles center peices.  I find it easiest to solve two centers on opposite sides of the cube before solving the position of the rest.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 3</h3>
		<p>
		This is the most time-consuming part of the puzzle.  Letting <code>X=(2/3)RU,(2/3),LF,FU,(2/3)RUi,(2/3)LFi</code>, a little-peddal-tri-cycle is given by <code>2[FU,LU],X,(2[FU,LU])i,Xi</code>.  Just 3 little peddals are tri-cycled across the <code>F</code>, <code>U</code> and <code>B</code> faces.
		</p>
		<p>
		Do as much as you can just with this sequence.  (You'll never need its symmetric varient, because you can just change your orientation of the entire puzzle.)  Eventually, however, you'll need to start using setup moves.  The setups becomes harder near the end of the solve, but they're never too terribly difficult.  Note that you may need to use the special move in a setup, so it helps to know how that kind of sequence moves the little peddals around.
