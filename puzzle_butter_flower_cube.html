		<h1>The Butter Flower Cube</h1>
		<p>
		As of this writing, I've only solved this once, but I'm going to do a write-up of it anyway.  It's a fun puzzle.
		I'm surprised at how both easy and hard it was.  Easy, because it didn't take long at all to find the necessary
		sequences, but also a bit hard, because the setups needed in the final step are difficult (but sometimes they get
		easier with practice.)  Anyhow, I wasn't able to always make reductions in the final step.  Rather, sometimes I had
		to turn one problem into another, or even back-track a bit.  Again, with practice, maybe the need for such things
		will no longer occur.
		</p>
		<p>
		There are 3 types of faces: large pedal, small pedal, and diamond.  (Should be reasonably clear which I mean here.)  And there
		is just one type of edge piece.  There are only two types of rotations: corner and edge.  (The faces don't turn.)
		</p>
		<h3>Step 1</h3>
		<p>
		Solve the diamonds first.  This is a trivial matter of turning the edges.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 2</h3>
		<p>
		Solve the edges next.  There is a trivial tri-cycle for this.  It's a commutator between and edge and corner.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 3</h3>
		<p>
		Solve the large pedals.  This is a trivial tri-cycle (or commutator) between adjacent edges.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 4</h3>
		<p>
		Solve the small pedals.  This is the trickiest part.  My stratagy was to perform the tri-cycle in <code>Step 3</code>,
		but with a setup ensure that all 3 large pedals involved are the same color.  This will tri-cycle 3 small pedals while
		leaving the rest of the cube invarient.  You then have to find setups for this stratagy to tri-cycle the desired triples
		of small pedals.  Where it gets tricky is in realizing that sometimes you have to change orbits in the setup sequence.
		Doing so requires a special move only available on the curvy-copter, which is a sub-group (or factor group?) of this cube.
		</p>
		<p>
		I suppose there might be a solve method where you first reduce the dube to a curvy-copter, and then solve as a curvy-copter.
		I'll have to give that a try.  My guess is that once reduced to a curvy-copter, you might encounter cases that can't happen
		on a normal curvy-copter.  This classic example, of course, is the 4x4 Rubic's Cube.  Once reduced to a 3x3, it's not necessarily
		a true 3x3, because you may encounter cases that can't happen on a normal 3x3, such as having a single edge flipped.
