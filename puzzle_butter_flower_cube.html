		<h1>The Butter Flower Cube</h1>
		<p>
		This is a fun puzzle that contains all the moves available on the curvy-copter.  I forget which.
		In any case, interestingly, I don't reduce it to a curvy-copter as you'll see in the steps below.
		</p>
		<p>
		There are 3 types of faces: large pedal, small pedal, and diamond.  (Should be reasonably clear which I mean here.)  And there
		is just one type of edge piece.  There are only two types of rotations: corner and edge.  (The faces don't turn.)
		</p>
		<h3>Step 1</h3>
		<p>
		Solve the diamonds first.  This is a trivial matter of turning the edges.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 2</h3>
		<p>
		Solve the edges next.  There is a trivial tri-cycle for this.  It's a commutator between an edge and corner.
		If the edges won't solve, turn a single corner once, and then continue tri-cycling.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 3</h3>
		<p>
		Solve the large pedals.  This is a trivial tri-cycle (or commutator) between adjacent edges.  Use corner and edge turns as setups.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 4</h3>
		<p>
		Solve the small pedals.  This is the trickiest part.  My stratagy was to perform the tri-cycle in <b>Step 3</b>,
		but with a trivial setup to ensure that all 3 large pedals involved are the <i>same</i> color.  This will tri-cycle 3 small pedals while
		leaving the rest of the cube invarient.  You then have to find setups for this stratagy to tri-cycle the desired triples
		of small pedals.  Where it gets tricky is in realizing that sometimes you have to change orbits in the setup sequence.
		Doing so requires a special move only available on the curvy-copter, which is a sub-group (or factor group?) of this cube.
