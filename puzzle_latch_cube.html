		<h1>Katsuhiko Okamoto's Latch Cube</h1>
		<p>
		Being the hardest puzzle I have, this one has got to be my favorite.  Admittedly, though I have solved this cube several times now, it has always required me to fumble in the dark through a portion of the solve.  Unlike every other twisty puzzle I own, I don't have a solution to this puzzle nailed down sufficiently that I could write a computer program to solve it.  What I will describe here is a strategy that works best for me.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 1</h3>
		<p>
		The main crux is getting the edge cubies into position with proper orientation whenever you can.  Make whatever rotations you think necessary, but I've found that edge cubie tri-cycling helps preserve what you already have solved.  With practice, you can recognize when a tri-cycle of the form <code>A,B,Ai,Bi</code> will go through or not.  You have to look at the arrows on the edge cubies concerned, and those on the two faces concerned in the commutator.  Often a setup move is useful to unlock faces temporarily, but beware when a setup move cannot be undone!  Be ready to back-out your sequence if it won't entirely go through.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 2</h3>
		<p>
		With all the edge cubies properly positioned, it's time to orient them.  I try to reach this step with at most two edge cubies improperly oriented.  The case when both such cubies have the same color arrow is easy to solve using a setup move in conjunction with Step 2 of my <a href="puzzle_rubiks_cube.html">Rubik's cube solution</a>.  This pair of edge cubie flips will go through when the edges to be flipped are on the 3 pair-wise adjacent faces that, when the cube is fully solved, all show the same color of arrows.
		</p>
		<p>
		If, however, both such cubies have arrows of different color, the matter is much more difficult.  What I've done in the past is flip one of those mis-oriented cubies with another edge cubie that was properly oriented, but of the differing arrow color.  This brings me to the first case mentioned a moment earlier.  To do this, I have sometimes needed to do a setup move in the middle of the edge-flip sequence to temporarily unlock a face.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 3</h3>
		<p>
		With all edge cubies properly positioned and oriented, the puzzle is now easy to solve.  I use the sequences in Step 3 from my <a href="puzzle_rubiks_cube.html">Rubik's cube solution</a> to get the corner cubies positioned, and I avoid setup moves for fear they may not be undone.  You just need to be able to recognize when the commutators will go through before you start them.  Interestingly, if the commutator goes through once, it always goes through any number of times.  So checking that <code>3[A,B,Ai,Bi]</code> will go through is only a matter of checking that <code>A,B,Ai,Bi</code> will go through.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 4</h3>
		<p>
		Variations of <code>2[Ri,Di,R,D],Ui,2[Di,Ri,D,R],U</code> can then be used to twist two corners at a time.  Again, you have to be careful not to start such a sequence unless you know it will go through.  Sometimes you have to twist a misoriented corner with an oriented one before you can orient two misoriented corners at the same time.  With persistence, the puzzle finally gets solved.
		</p>
		<p>
		Note that you can use the sequence given in Step 4 of my <a href="puzzle_rubiks_cube.html">Rubik's cube solution</a> if it is applied to the 3 pair-wise adjacent faces all sharing the same arrow color.
