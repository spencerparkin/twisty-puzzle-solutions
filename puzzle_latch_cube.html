		<h1>Katsuhiko Okamoto's Latch Cube</h1>
		<p>
		Being such a hard puzzle, this one has got to be my favorite.  Admittedly, though I have solved this cube several times now, it has always required me to fumble in the dark through a portion of the solve.  Unlike every other twisty puzzle I own, I don't have a solution to this puzzle nailed down sufficiently that I could write a computer program to solve it.  What I will describe here is a strategy that has worked for me.
