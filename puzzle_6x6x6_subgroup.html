		<h1>6x6x6 Subgroup</h1>
		<p>
		This puzzle is a subgroup of the 6x6x6 group generated by allowing only 180-degree rotations along the center cuts for the <code>XY</code> and <code>XZ</code> planes, while allowing any 90 degree rotation about any of the <code>YZ</code> planes.  (Of course, this idea generalizes to any NxNxN where N is even.)  What you get is a scramble of the 6x6x6 into a bunch of 3x3x1 blocks.  I will just refer to these as "blocks" for short.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you allow 90-degree rotations of the <code>XY</code> and <code>XZ</code> center cuts, it makes the puzzle a little funner.  Remember that there should only ever be 3x3x1 blocks in the scramble.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 1</h3>
		<p>
		Solve the 8 outer blocks on the left and right sides.  It's easy.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 2</h3>
		<p>
		Now solve any 4 inner blocks that reside all on a single edge of the cube.  It's also easy.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 3</h3>
		<p>
		The crux of the puzzle is now to position and orient the remaining 12 blocks.
		Begin by positioning and orienting all blocks for a single edge adjacent to the edge solved in step 2 using the penta-cycle <code>Q<sub>1</sub>=R*,2U,R*i,2U</code>
		and its symmetric equivilent <code>Q<sub>2</sub>=L*i,2U,L*,2U</code>.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 4</h3>
		<p>
		With 2 inner edges solved, only 8 blocks remain to be positioned and oriented.  You should be able to position them with the quad-cycle <code>Q<sub>3</sub>=2R*,2U,R*,2U,2R*</code>.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 5</h3>
		<p>
		All that remains is to orient the 8 remaining blocks.  The sequence <code>Q<sub>1</sub>,2Q<sub>2</sub>,Q<sub>1</sub>,Q<sub>3</sub></code> will flip 3 pair of blocks at a time across 3 edges of the cube.  Once you have it figured out, it's not hard to see how three applications of it, each from the appropriate perspective, will flip just a 1 pair of blocks; or how two applications will flip just 2 pair of blocks.
