		<h1>The 6x6x6 Rubik's Cube</h1>
		<p>
		This discussion generalizes to any <code>NxNxN</code>, and in doing so, I don't bother to give any sequences.  That withstanding, I still believe this is useful information.  Also, I would say that the puzzle is most interesting when <code>N</code> is even, because without center edge cubies, parity is harder to avoid.
		</p>
		<p>
		Note a fun bandaging of this puzzle <a href="puzzle_6x6x6_subgroup.html">here</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 1</h3>
		<p>
		I like to solve the faces first, ignoring the edges and corners.  The crux is the last two faces.  Use a simple and trivial commutator to tri-cycle center cubies between these two faces.  Don't worry about the centers all being solved correctly relative to one another, only that they are all one solid color.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 2</h3>
		<p>
		Now put the edges together.  A common strategy is to align an edge, then swap it out for an unsolved edge, then undo the damage made to the centers.
		The last few edges are the crux.  There is a simple commutator that will permutate edge cubies across two edges.  Note that the last edge may not solve completely due to parity.  Don't worry about it; we'll address that case later on.  Alternatively, all edges may appear, by the end of this step, to be completely re-assembled, but one of them may actually need to be swapped in its entirety.  We can detect that case later on.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 3</h3>
		<p>
		Now get the centers solved relative to one another.  It's interesting to see how doing so preserves the edges.  Split the cube in half a quater turn, turn a face 180-degrees across the split, unsplit, and turn the face again.  This simple commutator swaps whole face centers without disturbing edges.  Use the corner cubies to make sure you have the whole centers in the right places relative to one another.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 4</h3>
		<p>
		Now try to solve as a 3x3x3, even if one of your edges doesn't look complete.  Using layer-solve method, look at the orientations of the 4 remaining edges when you get to the final layer.  If there is an even number of them oriented correctly (or incorrectly), then all edges in the first 2 layers are oriented correctly, even if one of them appears entirely flipped.  On the other hand, if all edges in the first 2 layers are oriented correct, and there is an odd number of edges oriented correctly (or incorrectly) in the top layer, then one of those edges needs to be flipped.
		</p>
		<p>
		Resolving the parity in this step is just a matter of swapping one or more pairs of edges in a single edge block.  Of course, you can't do that with tri-cycles, so what you do is simply rotate a single inner-layer of the cube 1 quarter turn to perform a quad-cycle, resolve center peices, and then tri-cycle the edges into place.
		There is a simple tri-cycle commutator that permutes edges without messing up anything else about the cube.  In other words, it is a pure edge tri-cycle.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 5</h3>
		<p>
		Once you're sure that not only are all edge blocks completely re-assembled, but also oriented properly, complete the 3x3x3 solve.  At this stage, however, there is still one last type of parity you can encounter, and it is the case that the corners do not solve with tri-cycles.  To fix this, you have to swap a pair of whole edge blocks.  There is an easy sequence that does this.
		</p>
		<p>
		To give some intuition behind the parity, a slower, but more revealing way to solve the parity is to simply turn a singler outer-layer of the cube 1 quarter turn,
		pure-permute edges, then position and orient corners.  Thinking about it this way unifies the 2 types of parities encountered on the cube in the sense that they're both based on a single layer (inner or outer) being out of parity.
