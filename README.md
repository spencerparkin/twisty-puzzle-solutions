# twisty-puzzle-solutions

This is a web-site documenting original and well-known solutions to various twisty puzzles that I've found and learned over the years.  Owning dozens of such puzzles, documenting them all is an overwhelming task.  So what I've decided to do here is only give a high-level overview of how I solve each puzzle, and then only go into greater detail where needed, which usually means the end-game of the puzzle.

Here is the [page](https://spencerparkin.github.io/twisty-puzzle-solutions/) documenting the solutions, FWIW.

Here is my twisty-puzzle software [page](http://twisty-puzzle-page.herokuapp.com/), FWIW.
