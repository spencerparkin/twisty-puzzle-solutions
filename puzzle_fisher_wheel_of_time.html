		<h1>Fisher Wheel of Time</h1>
		<p>
		To be honest, I was a bit disappointed with this puzzle.  It's way, way easier
		than it looks.  I thought it might be a challenge, but it's super easy.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 1</h3>
		<p>
		Identify the peices of the puzzle that are equivilent to the Fisher cube,
		then just <a href="puzzle_fisher_cube.html">solve</a> those parts as you would a Fisher Cube.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 2</h3>
		<p>
		At this point, you need only assemble the "wheel"-parts of the puzzle.  This can
		be done with trivial conjugates and commutators that permute peices across the wheels.
		</p>
		<h4>Step 2a</h4>
		<p>
		Solve the edge-parts of the wheels using conjugates.  This is super easy, because you can ignore
		the scrambling of the corner-parts of the wheels as you do it.
		</p>
		<h4>Step 2b</h4>
		<p>
		Solve the corner-parts of the wheels using commutators.  This is very similar to
		permuting center peices of a 4x4x4 (or higher dimensional cube), except that orientation
		must be respected.  You can't get a peice in the right place with the wrong orientation,
		so never worry about that.
